 * nice_socket_recv_messages:

 * @recv_messages: (array length=n_recv_messages) (out caller-allocates):
 * array of #NiceInputMessages to return received messages in
 * @n_recv_messages: number of elements in the @recv_messages array
 *
 * Receive up to @n_recv_messages message on the socket, in a non-reliable,
 * non-blocking fashion. The total size of the buffers in each #NiceInputMessage
 * must be big enough to contain an entire message (65536 bytes), or excess
 * bytes will be silently dropped.
 *
 * On success, the number of messages received into @recv_messages is returned,
 * which may be less than @n_recv_messages if the call would have blocked
 * part-way through. If the socket would have blocked to begin with, or if
 * @n_recv_messages is zero, zero is returned. On failure, a negative value is
 * returned, but no further error information is available. Calling this
 * function on a socket which has closed is an error, and a negative value is
 * returned.
 *
 * If a positive N is returned, the first N messages in @recv_messages are
 * valid. Each valid message is guaranteed to have a non-zero
 * #NiceInputMessage::length, and its buffers are guaranteed to be filled
 * sequentially up to that number of bytes  If #NiceInputMessage::from was
 * non-%NULL for a valid message, it may be set to the address of the sender of
 * that received message.
 *
 * If the return value is zero or negative, the from return address and length
 * in every #NiceInputMessage in @recv_messages are guaranteed to be unmodified.
 * The buffers may have been modified.
 *
 * The base addresses and sizes of the buffers in a #NiceInputMessage are never
 * modified. Neither is the base address of #NiceInputMessage::from, nor the
 * base address and length of the #NiceInputMessage::buffers array.
 *
 * Returns: number of valid messages returned in @recv_messages, or a negative
 * value on error
 *
 * Since: 0.1.5
